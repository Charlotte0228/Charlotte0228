## üöÄ Projects

### [Multi-Region Tethered Path Planning](https://github.com/yourusername/multi-region-tethered-planning)
An algorithm for generating optimal Hamiltonian paths in multi-region environments with obstacles. This work was presented at [Conference Name] and builds upon the BEVPlace2 framework.

### [BEVPlace2 Optimization](https://github.com/zjuluolun/BEVPlace2)
Contributed to this project by optimizing the LiDAR-based global localization method for unmanned ground vehicles.

### [Tianbot Competition](https://github.com/tianbot/tianbot_docs)
Participated in the Tianbot competition using the Tianracer platform for autonomous navigation challenges.
